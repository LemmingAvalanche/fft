* TODO Make “head” and “tail” scripts

These scripts would act like the head(1) and tail(1) utilities except
that fft terminators are used instead of lines.  So if the “head” script
is named ~fft-head~, the invocation ~fft-head -5~ should output the
first five form feed-terminated sections of the file.
