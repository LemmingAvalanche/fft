fft — Form feed-terminated text files.

fft is a filetype where the string ~\f\n~ acts as a separator.  Thus it
can be used to store a list of contents that do not themself contain the
string ~\f\n~.

fft is supposed to work well with Unix-style text files (henceforth just
“text files”).  Such a file is [[http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/basedefs/V1_chap03.html#tag_03_403][defined as]]:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
A file that contains characters organized into zero or more lines.
#+END_QUOTE

And a “line” is [[http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/basedefs/V1_chap03.html#tag_03_206][defined as]]:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
A sequence of zero or more non-<newline> characters plus a terminating
<newline> character.
#+END_QUOTE

Conceptually, a fft file should be able to store a list of contents
which could be text files in their own right.
